# etl_json_csv_txt_to_SQL_db
An ETL pipeline that extracts data from a set of JSON, CVS and TXT files, and transforms them into a set of tables in an SQL database for easy querying

The project is based on a final project done with a cohort of Data Engineers, and takes an ERD produced by the team as a starting point for the database.
